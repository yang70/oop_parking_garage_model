# OOP Parking Garage Model

**Description**
This is a <bold>VERY</bold> rough sketch of what possible classes and their functions might be for a parking garage modeled with object oriented programming concepts.

I'm sure if I was to start coding these classes out it would change, and I am a bit leery at the interwoven nature of the classes.  I think I would need to limit the communication a bit, for example so the `Car` isn't communicating with the `Garage`, `Employee` and `Ticket`.  I think my inexperience with programming so far makes it a bit more difficult to conceptualize before doing.
